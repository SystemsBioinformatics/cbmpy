PySCeS CBMPy (http://cbmpy.sourceforge.net) is a new platform for constraint
based modelling and analysis. It has been designed using principles developed
in the PySCeS simulation software project: usability, flexibility and accessibility.
Its architecture is both extensible and flexible using data structures that are intuitive to
the biologist (metabolites, reactions, compartments) while transparently translating these into
the underlying mathematical structures used in advanced analysis (LP's, MILP's).

PySCeS CBMPy implements popular analyses such as FBA, FVA, element/charge
balancing, network analysis and model editing as well as advanced methods
developed specifically for the ecosystem modelling: minimal distance methods,
flux minimization and input selection. To cater for a diverse range of modelling
needs PySCeS CBMPy supports user interaction via:
